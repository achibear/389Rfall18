This was done via the [ELMS assignment](https://myelms.umd.edu/courses/1251976/assignments/4726433).

### Part 2 (75 pts)
1. After I found those problems, I will just tell my boss since he is the one who in charge of those stuff. If he ignores this for some reasons, I think I will probably keep trying to reach people with higher position until the problems are finished or the company decides to ignore those problems.
2. Since I'm not saint nor world saver, from my point of view, I will not go any further that beyond my job duty. I found problems and I told the person I should tell following company's rule. If company decide those problems are not a big deal. I think that's their right. Because by making decision, they are also taking the responsibility for whatever consequences the decision causes. So if any harm is caused by the decision, I will not feel guilty for it. Because I already did my job and fufil my responsibilities. Just like it is not the traffic light's fault when people ignore its red light and get hit by car.
    However, on the other hand, I may change my logic when the problems are really serious or against my moral baseline. For example, if the security issues are so serious that it can kill every user or the company is intended to use those security issues to kill people, I may tell the public about it at this point.
